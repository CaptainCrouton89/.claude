## 2025-10-09: refactored session history logging to use MCP server architecture

- created history-mcp.mjs at hooks/lifecycle/history-mcp.mjs implementing MCP server with logHistoryEntry tool
  - accepts structured schema with title and nested bullets (max 1 level deep)
  - handles file operations for .claude/memory/history.md with frontmatter preservation
  - prepends entries with newest-first ordering and automatic timestamp generation
- modified session-history-logger.mjs in hooks/lifecycle/session-history-logger.mjs to use MCP server instead of direct file editing
  - removed Edit and Write tools, keeping only Read tool access
  - added mcpServers configuration connecting to history-mcp.mjs
  - rewrote systemPrompt to focus on calling logHistoryEntry tool rather than direct file manipulation
  - updated completion logging to track tool calls instead of file edits
