## Oct 9, 2025
- improved system prompt in session-history-logger hook
  - modified systemPrompt in hooks/session-history-logger.mjs so that it follows best prompting practices with clear role definition, XML structure for organization, positive framing, and contextual explanations

## Oct 9, 2025
- implemented auto-cleanup for session history file
  - added section-based trimming logic to hooks/session-history-logger.mjs so that history.md is capped at 100 lines by removing oldest sections while preserving frontmatter

## Oct 9, 2025
- updated session history logger system prompt in hooks/session-history-logger.mjs so that it only documents substantive logic and feature changes, ignoring styling, comments, and formatting
  - modified prompt to use relative file paths from project root instead of absolute paths
  - added SKIP output handling so trivial-only changes don't create history entries
