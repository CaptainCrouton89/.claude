## 2025-10-09: refactored session history logger to focus on functional changes only

- modified session-history-logger.mjs in hooks/lifecycle/ to exclude assistant responses and track only functional codebase changes
- removed custom-reminder.py from hooks/user-prompt-submit/ (97 lines deleted)

## 2025-10-09: created and refined PRD template for new projects

- created file-templates/prd.template.md with comprehensive 500+ line template
  - included executive summary, user personas, user stories with acceptance criteria
  - documented technical architecture, stack decisions, and system design
  - initially included full project lifecycle sections (security, testing, deployment, timeline, budget)
- refined template by removing operational sections per user request
  - removed security, testing, deployment requirements
  - removed timeline, risks, budget, and launch plan sections
  - focused final template on product vision, user requirements, and technical architecture only

## 2025-10-09: completed comprehensive hooks system investigation

- investigated activity tracking system
  - documented 10 activity categories with AI-powered classification using gpt-4.1-mini
  - mapped protocol injection logic with confidence (≥0.8) and activity-specific effort thresholds
  - traced data flow from user input through classification to protocol injection
- investigated hook lifecycle and execution framework
  - documented 7 lifecycle events (UserPromptSubmit, SessionStart, SessionEnd, ToolCall, ToolCallError, ToolCallResult, BashCommandExecution)
  - mapped parallel execution observer and hook orchestration patterns
  - identified error handling with multiple fallback mechanisms
- investigated memory and history management architecture
  - documented three-tier storage: structured history.md, raw history.jsonl, per-session file-history/
  - mapped MCP integration with logHistoryEntry tool for automated session logging
  - traced session lifecycle from capture through LLM analysis to persistent storage
- investigated protocol system with 9 specialized workflows
  - documented protocols: BUG-FIXING, CODE-REVIEW, DOCUMENTATION, FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT, INVESTIGATION, PLANNING, REQUIREMENTS-GATHERING, SECURITY-AUDIT, TESTING
  - mapped activity-to-protocol selection algorithm with threshold-based injection
  - identified session state tracking to prevent duplicate protocol injections
- investigated external service integrations
  - documented 3 LLM integrations (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI) with unified OAuth authentication
  - mapped extensive MCP server ecosystem (history, validation, json, sql, ide)
  - identified secure credential management using OAuth with environment variable fallbacks

## 2025-10-09: investigated memory and history management system architecture

- mapped complete history storage system from .claude/memory/ to MCP integration
  - primary storage: .claude/memory/history.md with markdown format and YAML frontmatter
  - session transcripts: history.jsonl for raw conversation data
  - file-level tracking: file-history/ directory with UUID-based session tracking
- traced MCP server architecture for history logging at hooks/lifecycle/history-mcp.mjs
  - implements logHistoryEntry tool with structured schema validation
  - handles frontmatter timestamp updates and newest-first entry ordering
  - provides debug logging to mcp-server-debug.log for troubleshooting
- documented session history lifecycle from capture to storage
  - capture: SessionEnd hook triggers session-history-logger.mjs
  - analysis: LLM processes conversation to extract substantive changes
  - storage: MCP server writes formatted entries to history.md with timestamps
- identified activity tracking integration with memory system
  - activity-tracker.js categorizes work (debugging, planning, etc.) with confidence/effort scoring
  - triggers protocol injection for complex tasks (confidence ≥0.8, effort ≥threshold)
  - logs activity data for session context and workflow optimization

## 2025-10-09: removed redundant custom-reminder hook in favor of activity tracker

- deleted hooks/user-prompt-submit/custom-reminder.py and its __pycache__
  - functionality now handled by hooks/state-tracking/activity-tracker.js
  - activity tracker injects PLANNING protocol when detecting planning activity (confidence ≥0.8, effort ≥3)
- removed custom-reminder hook reference from settings.json

## 2025-10-09: refactored session history logging to use MCP server architecture

- created history-mcp.mjs at hooks/lifecycle/history-mcp.mjs implementing MCP server with logHistoryEntry tool
  - accepts structured schema with title and nested bullets (max 1 level deep)
  - handles file operations for .claude/memory/history.md with frontmatter preservation
  - prepends entries with newest-first ordering and automatic timestamp generation
- modified session-history-logger.mjs in hooks/lifecycle/session-history-logger.mjs to use MCP server instead of direct file editing
  - removed Edit and Write tools, keeping only Read tool access
  - added mcpServers configuration connecting to history-mcp.mjs
  - rewrote systemPrompt to focus on calling logHistoryEntry tool rather than direct file manipulation
  - updated completion logging to track tool calls instead of file edits
