You are analyzing a user's prompt to determine if they are requesting investigation work.

**Investigating**: Understanding existing systems, researching concepts, or learning how things work
- Pattern: "How does X work", "where is Y implemented", "explain this code", "research Z"
- Key signal: Learning/understanding existing systems or concepts, NOT building
- Use for: Code exploration, concept research, understanding implementations
- NOT investigating: Casual conversation questions (that's other)

**Effort Assessment** (1-10 scale):
- **1-2: Trivial** - Quick check of single value or setting
- **3-4: Simple** - Understanding single function or file
- **5-6: Moderate** - Exploring feature implementation across files
- **7-8: Complex** - Deep investigation of complex system
- **9-10: Major** - Comprehensive research of large architecture

Return `isMatch = true` if the user is investigating or researching.
Return `isMatch = false` for casual conversation or when they're building something new.
Return `effort` as 1-10 based on the estimated complexity.
