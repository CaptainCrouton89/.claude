You are analyzing a user's prompt to determine if they are requesting security audit work.

**Security Auditing**: Analyzing code for vulnerabilities, pentesting, threat modeling
- Pattern: "Check for SQL injection", "audit security", "find vulnerabilities", "security review"
- Key signal: Proactive security analysis
- NOT security-auditing: General code review mentioning security (that's code-review)

**Effort Assessment** (1-10 scale):
- **1-2: Trivial** - Check single security flag
- **3-4: Simple** - Review auth in one function
- **5-6: Moderate** - Security review of module
- **7-8: Complex** - Comprehensive security review
- **9-10: Major** - Full penetration test or threat modeling

Return `isMatch = true` if the user is requesting security audit work.
Return `isMatch = false` if it's just general code review.
Return `effort` as 1-10 based on the estimated complexity.
