# State Tracking System

## Overview
This directory implements intelligent activity tracking and protocol injection for Claude conversations. The system categorizes developer activities using AI and injects contextual protocols when appropriate.

## Key Components

### activity-tracker.js
Main hook that runs on `UserPromptSubmit`. Analyzes conversation history to:
- Categorize activity (10 categories: debugging, feature, investigating, etc.)
- Score effort level (1-10 scale)
- Inject protocol context when confidence â‰¥ 0.8 and effort meets threshold

### Activity Categories & Thresholds
Each activity has an effort threshold that triggers protocol injection:
- **debugging**: 3 (low barrier for assistance)
- **code-review**: 3
- **security-auditing**: 4
- **requirements-gathering**: 5
- **planning**: 5
- **investigating**: 6
- **feature**: 7 (higher barrier - more autonomous work expected)
- **documenting**: 7
- **testing**: 7
- **other**: 10 (never inject)

### Protocol Selection Logic
- **Moderate protocol**: For `planning`, `investigating`, `feature`, `testing` activities when effort is threshold to threshold+2
  - Example: Planning at effort 5-7 uses moderate.md
- **Strong protocol**: For all other qualifying activities or when effort > threshold+2

### Session State Management
- State persists in `~/.claude/conversation-state/{session_id}.json`
- Tracks: protocol name, effort level, timestamp
- Controls reminder verbosity: minimal if same protocol + equal/lower effort, full otherwise

## Protocol Structure
Protocols live in `protocols/{activity-name}/` with:
- `moderate.md`: Lighter guidance for mid-complexity tasks
- `strong.md`: Comprehensive workflows for complex work

## Important Patterns

### Transcript Parsing
- Expands `@file` notation by reading files from cwd
- Truncates content >400 chars (200 chars from start + 200 from end)
- Filters hook outputs from conversation history
- Limits to 6 recent exchanges for LLM context

### Effort Scoring Guidelines
1-2: Trivial (<10min) | 3-4: Simple (10-30min) | 5-6: Moderate (30-90min)
7-8: Complex (2-4hrs) | 9-10: Major (hours to days)

## Dependencies
- `ai` + `@ai-sdk/openai`: LLM categorization using gpt-4.1-mini
- `zod`: Schema validation for structured output
