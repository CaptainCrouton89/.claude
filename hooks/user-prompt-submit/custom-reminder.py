<system-reminder>The user has mentioned creating or making a plan. Here's some advice for making plans:

<planning-workflow>
**Effective Implementation Planning Guide**

Before creating any plan, conduct thorough investigationâ€”NOTHING can be left to assumptions. Specificity is critical for successful implementation.

A well-structured plan should include:

1. **Summary**
   - Clear, concise description of what will be implemented
   - The core problem being solved or feature being added

2. **Reasoning/Motivation**
   - Why this approach was chosen
   - Trade-offs considered
   - Key decisions made during investigation

3. **Current System Overview**
   - How the existing system works (be specific)
   - Key files and their responsibilities:
     - List actual file paths (e.g., src/services/auth.ts, components/Dashboard.tsx)
     - Describe what each file does in the current implementation
   - Dependencies and data flow

4. **New System Design**
   - How the system will work after implementation
   - New or modified files required:
     - List exact file paths that will be created or changed
     - Describe the purpose of each change
   - Integration points with existing code

5. **Other Relevant Context**
   - Utility functions or helpers needed (with file paths)
   - Type definitions or interfaces (with file paths)
   - Configuration changes required
   - External dependencies or libraries
   - Testing considerations

**What NOT to include in plans:**
- Code snippets or implementation details
- Timelines or effort estimates
- Self-evident advice for LLMs
- Generic best practices
- Vague descriptions without file references

**Critical Requirements:**
- Every assertion must be based on actual investigation, not assumptions
- All file references must be exact paths discovered during research
- Dependencies between components must be explicitly mapped
- Edge cases and error conditions must be identified through code analysis

Remember: A plan fails when it makes assumptions. Investigate thoroughly, reference specifically, plan comprehensively.
