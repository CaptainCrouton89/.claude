# Create Product Requirements Document

Your job is to collaborate with the user to draft the PRD, then save it to `docs/product-requirements.md` using the template at @/file-templates/init-project/product-requirements.md.

---

## Pre-flight: re-initialize context
1. Read @/file-templates/init-project/product-requirements.md to understand the structure.
2. Read @/file-templates/init-project/CLAUDE.md for cross-document conventions.
3. Read `<project_root>/docs/charter.md` to extract goals, scope, and success metrics.
4. Check if `<project_root>/docs/product-requirements.md` already exists. If so, read it and ask whether to improve/replace/skip.

---

## Process
1. Derive from charter:
   - Summary: goal, primary users, key problems solved
   - Initial feature list with IDs (F-01..F-n) based on scope
   - Success metrics aligned to charter KPIs

2. Ask for or confirm:
   - User stories stub (defer detailed stories to step 04; here just include 1â€“2 examples per top feature)
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability, compliance, scalability)
   - Risks and mitigations

3. Make reasonable assumptions, call them out, and ask for confirmation.

4. Produce a draft with:
   - Feature List table (ID, Feature, Priority, Description, Owner)
   - Success Metrics table (Metric, Target, Measurement Method)
   - Risks table (Risk, Likelihood, Impact, Mitigation)

5. Present summary and ask for sign-off.

6. On sign-off, write the file with `version: 0.1`, `status: draft`, `last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD`.

---

## Output format
- Exactly match @/file-templates/init-project/product-requirements.md structure.

---

## Save location
- `<project_root>/docs/product-requirements.md`

---

## Traceability
- Feature IDs (F-01..F-n) must be unique and will be referenced by user stories, feature specs, and API contracts.
- Success metrics will drive the data plan.
