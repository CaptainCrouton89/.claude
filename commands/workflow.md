$ARGUMENTS

Using strategic agent delegation, execute the complete feature development lifecycle: requirements gathering → codebase investigation → implementation planning. Deploy specialized agents for complex work while validating implementation incrementally and comprehensively continuously throughout implementation, and again at the end. 

Requirements, investigation, and planning should all output one ore more documents that can be shared between agents. A plan that cites multiple files of investigation will be more useful. 

Implementation agents should have access to the investigation and plan documents created.

Validation agents should have access to everything, and should systematically validate all requirements have been met.

Orchestrate thoughtfully.
